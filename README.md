# MEET-STREET
This project was built as a part of the Microsoft Engage Program 2021 .
It is a functional video-calling web app, with inbuilt chat feature, where 2 or more people can join to video-call and chat.
Agile Software Development Methodology has been used for planning and development of the web app.


## Problem Statement 

 *The problem statement for Microsoft Engage 2021 is to clone Microsoft Teams. 
 It should be a working prototype with one mandatory feature - **a minimum of two participants should be able to connect via your product to have a video conversation** .*

## Tech Stack :

- ### Node Js and Express :
  
  - Node.js is a runtime environment that allows us to run JavaScript code independent of a web browser.
  - ExpressJS is a server framework for Node.js.
  
- ### EJS :
   
   - EJS  is a simple framework that will allow us to render and serve HTML files from our Express server.
  
- ### UUID :
    
    - UUID is a protocol for generating a random unique identifier. 
    - When a user first opens our chat app, we are going to create a room for them with a unique identifier.

- ### WebRTC and PeerJs :
       
     - WebRTC (Real-Time Communication) is the underlying technology in browsers and mobile apps that allows for real-time communication.
     - I have used PeerJS for the purpose, which is built on top of WebRTC.

- ### Socket.io :
      
     - Socket.io is a r JavaScript library for creating real-time communication apps.
     - Used server side library to manage communication between users.
     
     
 - ### Auth0 SDK :
       
     - Auth0 SDK has been used for authentication.
